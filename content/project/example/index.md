I model endogenous fluctuations in consumer sentiment and endogenous business cycles in a social learning framework, incorporated within a two sector, general equilibrium, New Keynesian model. I identify the theoretical conditions required for generating endogenous and asymmetric cycles in this class of models. The learning dynamics depend on the variances of signal distributions and the degree of differentiability between the two hidden states of nature. For some parameters, convergence of sentiment to the truth in response to a false positive shock is very slow and rational herds emerge on the wrong action. For other parameters, I get endogenous cycles in beliefs and business cycle variables, leading to fast convergence to the truth. My model also demonstrates asymmetric effects of consumer sentiments on business cycles across business cycle regimes, which is consistent with evidence from stylized facts that I document from US data based on local projections. I do not have quantitative goals but I provide a consumer sentiment, social learning and information frictions based theory of endogenous and asymmetric business cycle fluctuations.
